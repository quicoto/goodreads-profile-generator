When innocent lives are at stake, every shot fired is danger close...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport "tunnels" known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the <i>Second Chance</i>, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.<br /><br />Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends.<br /><br />Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth... and humanity itself. Could it be that Johansson was right?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The Gray Man is back in another nonstop international thriller from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling coauthor of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels</b><br /><br />Fresh off his first mission back with the CIA, Court Gentry secures what seems like a cut-and-dried contract job: A group of expats in Paris hires him to kidnap the mistress of Syrian dictator Ahmed Azzam to get intel that could destabilize Azzam's regime. <br /><br />Court delivers Bianca Medina to the rebels, but his job doesn't end there. She soon reveals that she has given birth to a son, the only heir to Azzam's rule--and a potent threat to the Syrian president's powerful wife. <br /><br />Now, to get Bianca's cooperation, Court must bring her son out of Syria alive. With the clock ticking on Bianca's life, he goes off the grid in a free-fire zone in the Middle East--and winds up in the right place at the right time to take a shot at bringing one of the most brutal dictatorships on earth to a close...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Listening Length: 16 hours and 57 minutes</i><br /><br /><b>Civil war looms in the Bobiverse in this brand-new, epic-length adventure by best seller Dennis E. Taylor.</b><br /><br />More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Bender’s fate—whatever the cost.<br /><br />But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bob’s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bob’s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverse’s problems.<br /><br />Undaunted, Bob and his allies follow Bender’s trail. But what they discover out in deep space is so unexpected and so complex that it could either save the universe—or pose an existential threat the likes of which the Bobiverse has never faced.]]></book_description>

They want to kick Gentry off the flight but are overruled by CIA headquarters.
