# Goodreads Profile Generator

NodeJS scripts to fetch Goodreads profile information on Currently Reading, To Read and Read books.

It stores the books in `.txt` files for later processing into HTML output.

## To Do

- [ ] Update 3 txt files as database from the RSS
  - [ ] Currently reading: should be cleaned on each fetch
  - [ ] Want To Read: should be cleaned on each fetch
  - [ ] Read: should not delete but only update if not found
- [ ] Update the files with the found books (year, title, link, score)

## Live

This how it looks like [on my site](https://ricard.blog/books/) when pasting the generated HTML is pasted into a WordPress page:
