# Goodreads Profile Generator

NodeJS scripts to fetch Goodreads profile information on Currently Reading, To Read and Read books.

It stores the books in `.txt` files for processing into HTML output.

The `.txt` files are stored in the repo and updated when the XML files from Goodreads are updated. Thus, you don't only rely on the XML but your own persisent database.

## Live

This how it looks like [on my site](https://ricard.blog/books/) when pasting the generated HTML is pasted into a WordPress page.
